# The Bidding System Project

### Time is wasted waiting for sellers and buyers to bid on prices so a successful transaction can occur. This project explores the possibilities of automating a system for platform companies.

-	Obtained shill bidding data from eBay, a large online bidding selling platform, with more than 600,000 transaction points
-	Explored descriptive statistics for fraud and late-bidding systems in transactions
-	Developing a neural network to bid instantaneously upon initial bid
